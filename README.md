### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
About me: Java/kotlin enthusiast.<br>
Iâ€™m currently working on redesigning EarthquakeFinder application to REST application and pushing it to Heroku. <br>
Future: I would like to develop full OCR app for receipts - detecting letters, edges, deskewing image, improve black-white saturation using Adaptive thresholding algorithm etc.<br> If you like this idea, you can reach me on my mail or open issue with new idea in ThesisBudgetSystem repository. <br>
Finally step will be finishing algorithm which will recognize output from OCR and produce list of products and prices.
